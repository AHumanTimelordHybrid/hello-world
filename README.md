# hello-world
Just a place for me to store things

Hi, I'm a physics student at Queens Uni Belfast. 
Part of my course involves using programming languages, such as python and matlab, to solve problems.
I aim to become proficient in Python 2 by the end of my second academic year. 
Currently, I am using 'Learn Python 2 the Hard Way' as a guide.

My hobbies include gaming, sleeping, eating, breathing, ... and that's about it.
